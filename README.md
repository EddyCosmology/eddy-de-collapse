# EddyCosmology: Staggered Probabilistic Collapses for Evolving Dark Energy

**Phenomenological model inspired by DESI DR2 hints of dynamical dark energy.**

This repository contains the draft preprint (February 4, 2026) and supporting materials for a minimally coupled scalar field model addressing evolving dark energy consistent with DESI Data Release 2 (2025) results. The model uses staggered probabilistic collapses (multiplicative stochastic noise inspired by CSL/objective collapse theories) to suppress vacuum energy catastrophes, combined with nonlinear advection, higher-derivative hyperdiffusion, and mild RG-inspired running vacuum Λ(H) = Λ₀ + 3ν H² — all without introducing new physics.

### Key Features
- w(z) evolution from near -1 (high z) to ≈ -0.86 locally, matching DESI hints (w₀ > -1, wₐ < 0 at ~2.8–4.2σ).
- Low stochastic scatter (≲0.001), mild σ₈ suppression (~0.804 vs. Planck 0.811), H₀ boost (~71.8 km/s/Mpc).
- Relational quantum-classical framework (Einstein-Bohr complementarity via stochastic damping).
