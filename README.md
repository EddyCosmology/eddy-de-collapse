# EddyCosmology: Staggered Probabilistic Collapses for Evolving Dark Energy

**Phenomenological model inspired by DESI DR2 hints of dynamical dark energy.**

This repository contains the draft preprint (February 4, 2026) and supporting materials for a minimally coupled scalar field model addressing evolving dark energy consistent with DESI Data Release 2 (2025) results. The model uses staggered probabilistic collapses (multiplicative stochastic noise inspired by CSL/objective collapse theories) to suppress vacuum energy catastrophes, combined with nonlinear advection, higher-derivative hyperdiffusion, and mild RG-inspired running vacuum Λ(H) = Λ₀ + 3ν H² — all without introducing new physics beyond established quantum mechanics and general relativity.

*Artist's impression of the cosmic web: filaments connecting galaxies and clusters, with vast voids in between (NASA/ESA/Hubble, public domain/CC-BY 4.0). Relevant to the model's filament-void redshift asymmetries (Δz/z ~0.05–0.10).*

### Key Features
- **w(z) evolution**: From near -1 (high redshift) to ≈ -0.86 locally, matching DESI hints (w₀ > -1, wₐ < 0 in w₀wₐCDM fits at ~2.8–4.2σ significance depending on supernova samples).
- **Numerical results**: 50 noise realization ensembles (low stochastic scatter ≲0.001), filament-void asymmetries (Δz/z ~0.05–0.10), mild σ₈ suppression (~0.804 vs. Planck 0.811), and H₀ boost (~71.8 km/s/Mpc).
- **Philosophy**: Relational framework reconciling Einstein's definite outcomes with Bohr's complementarity via stochastic damping of vacuum fluctuations.
- **Testable predictions**: Stochastic non-Gaussianity in CMB lensing/large-scale structure, growth rate tweaks.
